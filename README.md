# Minikube Kubernetes: Running Kubernetes Locally

This tutorial will guide you through setting up Kubernetes locally using Minikube and deploying a simple application to test your setup.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following tools are installed on your machine:

- **Kubectl** – The Kubernetes command-line tool.
- **Minikube** – A tool for running Kubernetes clusters locally.

## Step 1: Start Minikube

Launch a local Kubernetes cluster with the following command:

```bash
minikube start
```

Minikube will set up a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your machine. This will take a few minutes.

## Step 2: Open Minikube Dashboard

Minikube offers a built-in web-based dashboard to manage your Kubernetes cluster. To open the dashboard, run:

```bash
minikube dashboard
```

This command will open the dashboard in your browser, where you can view and interact with your cluster resources.

*Here, you can add the screenshot of the dashboard once it’s running.*

## Step 3: Deploy the "Hello Minikube" App

Let's deploy a simple app to the cluster. First, create a deployment with the following command:

```bash
kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.39 -- /agnhost netexec --http-port=8080
```

Next, expose this deployment so that it can be accessed externally via a LoadBalancer:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment hello-node --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
```

The service is now running and accessible through your Minikube cluster.

## Step 4: Access the Application

To access your app from the browser, run the following command:

```bash
minikube service hello-node
```

Minikube will open the service in your default browser, allowing you to interact with the "Hello Minikube" app.

**Example Screenshot**  
*Include a screenshot showing the app running in your browser.*

## Step 5: View Pod Logs

To view the logs of the running pods, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl logs <your-pod-name>
```

This will show you the output and logs generated by the app.

**Example Screenshot**  
*Include a screenshot of the logs window.*

## Step 6: Clean Up

When you're done, clean up the deployed resources by running:

```bash
kubectl delete service hello-node
kubectl delete deployment hello-node
```

To stop Minikube:

```bash
minikube stop
```

If you no longer need Minikube, delete it entirely:

```bash
minikube delete
```
